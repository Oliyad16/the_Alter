## Introduction

Welcome to The Altar. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

**In Short:** We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information. Everything stays on your device.

---

## Information Collection and Use

### What We Collect

**Nothing.** The Altar does not collect any personal information from users.

### What Stays on Your Device

The following information is stored locally on your device only:

- **Reading Preferences**: Your Bible reading commitments and goals
- **Bible Reading History**: Which chapters you've read and your progress
- **Prayer Data**: Your prayer sessions, prayer items, and answered prayers
- **Verse Notes**: Any highlights, notes, or bookmarks you create
- **App Settings**: Your preferences for font size, themes, and notification settings
- **Alarm Configuration**: Your prayer alarm schedules

**Important:** This data:

---

## Third-Party Services

### API.Bible

The Altar uses [API.Bible](https://scripture.api.bible) to provide Bible scripture content.

**What This Means:**
- When you read the Bible in the app, your device sends requests to API.Bible servers to fetch scripture text
- API.Bible may collect standard web server logs (IP address, request time, etc.)
- We do not control API.Bible's data practices

**API.Bible Privacy Policy:** https://scripture.api.bible/privacy

**What We Don't Send:**
- Your name, email, or any personal identifiers
- Your reading history or preferences
- Your prayer data or notes

The only information API.Bible receives is:
- Which Bible verses/chapters you request
- Standard technical information (device type, iOS version)

---

## No User Accounts

The Altar does not require you to create an account. There are no:
- Email addresses collected
- Passwords to remember
- Login credentials
- User profiles

The app works completely offline after initial setup (though Bible content requires internet to load).

---

## No Tracking or Analytics

The Altar does not use:
- Analytics services (no Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- Crash reporting tools
- Advertising networks
- User behavior tracking
- Location tracking
- Cross-app tracking

We have no idea how you use the app—and that's intentional.

---

## Children's Privacy

The Altar is appropriate for all ages (rated 4+). Because we don't collect any personal information, we comply with children's privacy regulations including COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

---

## Data Security

Since all your data is stored locally on your device:
- **You** are in control of your data security
- We recommend using device passcode/biometric protection
- Regular device backups will preserve your data
- Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all data

---

## Your Data Rights

You have the following rights regarding your data:

### Access
All your data is accessible within the app at any time:
- View reading history in the Bible reader
- View prayers in "The Meeting Place"
- View answered prayers in "Remembered"
- View settings in the Settings tab

### Export
Currently, there is no built-in export feature. Your data is stored in iOS UserDefaults and can be backed up via iCloud backup if enabled on your device.

### Deletion
To delete all your data:
1. Uninstall The Altar from your device
2. If you've backed up your device to iCloud, you may want to delete the app data from iCloud settings
